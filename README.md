# User Information RESTful API on Go: Fiber, MongoDB Atlas

## Description
REST API for a User Information application in which we create new users, view them, update & delete their information. Here I used a NoSQL database MongoDB for storing the data.

    Rest of the requirements are pulled by the Go and database is already configured. Can be changed by editing `.env` file.
